# Bimbi-API-Test

### Steps to start

## Aim

This test aims at checking the following in your implementation:

- Integrating third-party APIs
- MySQL efficiency, migrations etc
- Documenting with postman
- Writing Restful API knowledge
- JS Knowledge
- API responses
- Database Transaction.
- Schema Structure.
- Adonis Knowledge

## Instructions and Integrations

You will be building a basic fin tech  API with the following User stories.

- User can create an account(Basic Information- email, name, password)
- User can fund their Account with Card or Bank Transfer.
- User can send money to another User using their email.
- User can add beneficiaries (bank to withdraw to).
- User can only withdraw money to their Beneficiaries.
- Use webhook only to confirm if transfer or funding is successful (checkout Ngrok to help out).
- Writing tests for this is a plus

Kindly expose APIs to enable these activities be carried out. You can abstract all external API calls to payment providers for **Funding Account** and **Withdraw money**  

NB: Use Paystack or Flutterwave for external APIs

Once done please add your postman documentation to your GitHub/ Bitbucket repo readme and send the link to your repo to **wole@buyfood.app.**

Please ensure your postman documentation is attached unless your submission will be rendered void.
